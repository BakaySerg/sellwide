						<h3 class="h3">The practice of communicating with prospective consumers or target audiences on multiple social media platforms is known as social media management.</h3>
						<p>It includes maintaining your brand's social presence, keeping track of your connections with prospective consumers, and providing material on social media networks. Almost all companies promote via social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter.</p>
						<p>However, social media management is more than simply keeping you up to speed on all of your company's postings and news. It enhances your social media marketing services, connects with the audience, and anticipates new chances for your companies, which is the most effective strategy to raise their exposure to consumers. With that, you must understand how your business will maintain its social media image with consistency and goodwill. Two brands cannot be identical. You may make your brand noticeable and distinctive with the help of the right social media management service providers, which will be the final cause for your brand's success.</p>

								<h5 class="accordion__title">Are you publishing on my behalf as a Social Media Manager?</h5>
							</div>
							<div class="accordion__hidden">
								<p>Yes, I'm posting on your social media pages as YOU, using your handles. The only way someone will know it's me posting rather than you is if you tell them.</p>

						<div class="accordion__item">
							<div class="accordion__trigger" data-collapse>
								<h5 class="accordion__title">What platforms are you in charge of?</h5>
							</div>
							<div class="accordion__hidden">
								<p>Twitter, Facebook fan page, Facebook group, Instagram, and Pinterest are now available for any brand. LinkedIn may also be controlled on a case-by-case basis in certain circumstances. The reason for this is that LinkedIn is only utilized as a professional network and is not used in the same way as other sites.</p>

								<h5 class="accordion__title">Do you walk into the room and answer people's questions?</h5>

								<p>Absolutely! Customer service is an important aspect of social networking. We can't let your loving followers down!</p>

								<h5 class="accordion__title">How often will you update your social media accounts?</h5>
							</div>
							<div class="accordion__hidden">
								<p>There are many packages available, each with its own minimum posting schedule. The reason for this is because some individuals just want their accounts to seem active, while others want to intentionally expand their following and sell some goods. Each aim has a distinct degree of publishing.</p>
