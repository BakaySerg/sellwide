								<h5 class="accordion__title">Could you please clarify Ecommerce SEO and the procedures involved?</h5>
							</div>
							<div class="accordion__hidden">
								<p>Ecommerce SEO refers to a set of optimization techniques used to boost search ranks for e-commerce portals and specialized product sites. This includes off-page and on-page optimization for the online retail platform, as well as specific link building operations, content marketing, and influencer outreach campaigns.</p>

								<h5 class="accordion__title">How long will it take for my online company to be on the first page of search results?</h5>
							</div>
							<div class="accordion__hidden">
								<p>Committing accomplishment schedules for achieving outcomes is challenging, especially if your online store category has a significant number of competitive products. Online stores are massive, get search queries from desktop and mobile devices, and need a significant amount of product-specific information and digital marketing. As a consequence, optimizing them requires a substantial amount of time and effort.</p>
								<p>However, based on our expertise working with businesses, we have seen them achieve long tail keyword rankings in three months and competitive keyword rankings in six months.</p>

								<h5 class="accordion__title">How much should I spend for Ecommerce SEO Services?</h5>
							</div>
							<div class="accordion__hidden">
								<p>We spend a significant amount of time and work preparing a business proposal for each Ecommerce SEO project due to the scale of its scope. Our effort estimates are based on the size of your portal, your short and long-term marketing objectives, the number and quality of keywords we are targeting, the age of your website, and the competition for those local keywords among the top industry players.</p>
								<p>Because efficient Ecommerce SEO is a specific endeavor with no "one-size-fits-all" solution, we would want you to contact our team for a quick phone conversation to get an exact quotation.</p>

Our clients, depending on their preferences, either have their own teams execute such update requests or leave the alterations to our team, which is completely capable of doing so.</p>
